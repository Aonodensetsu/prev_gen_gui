# Terms of Service

## TL;DR

Use common sense. Behave nicely to me and I'll return the favor.

## Not TL;DR

This is a personal project, provided to you free of charge and open source, based on an equally free of charge and open source library.

The entire code is available, if you want to request any fixes, improvements, or changes, reach out via my GitHub:  
[backend library](https://github.com/Aonodensetsu/prev_gen/issues) / [GUI](https://github.com/Aonodensetsu/prev_gen_gui/issues)

Or make your own changes, keep a fork, send them over in a pull request, whatever your heart desires.

1. Don't spam my server.

The server will block you if you try anyway.  
If you want to use the service heavily, set up your own instance, it costs nothing.

2. Don't be a dick.

Really, I don't interact with (and will be actively malicious) if you try to exploit me.  
So just don't, and it'll be more fun for the both of us.  
I reserve all rights to categorize what being a dick is.

### Conclusions

That's really about it, as long as you comply with the [license](License.html) you can do whatever and I can't stop you.  
You won't get far in society with just that, however.
